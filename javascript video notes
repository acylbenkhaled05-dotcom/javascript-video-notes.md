Notes from web development videos:

 video 1x : none
 video 2x : i did not no how popular was java script and how versatile it was, it is nice to know 
 video 3x : always have node js whenever you need to run java script code
 video 4x : none since i already have vs code and node js installed 
 video 5x : learned the installation of node js 
 video 6x : the point of console.log is to output a message to the console windows
percent s is to make appear your varriable in the text or $(var)
 video 7x : there's /* for multi line command
 video 8x : good demo
 video 9x : var let and const are the three declarations for your variables 
let and const are more suited for block scoped
 video 10 : nice demo
 video 11 : string concatenation is used by the '+', it adds string variables together
 video 13 : formatting strings is level after the concatenation where you can flip your variables or add them with easier commands
 video 15 : none 
 video 17 : ++ = +1 and -- = -1
 video 19 : none
 video 21 : these three functions will run depending if theres an exception
finally whether there is one or not

to initiate your var : const now = new Date();
you can customize your date as precise as you want with your vars

year, month, day, hour, minutes, seconds
video 25 : for if statements always use === to your numbers so you don't get an error
video 26 : nice demo for bool, took notes of the code structure
video 28 : nice demo 
video 31 : lenght larger than the index, meaning that it will always start at 0
